# Project-5---Spotify-Search-App

In this project, you'll build a "Album Search" app using the Spotify API.

You'll need to use your knowledge of basic JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX including loading JSON data from a server using a GET HTTP request.

We'll give you basic HTML, CSS, and a JavaScript file to get you started. You'll need to program the search form to return album data in JSON format based on the form submission. You'll use the API data to dynamically create HTML displaying an album's title, artist, and album art image.
